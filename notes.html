<h1> A bit about the internet</h1>

<h2>URL</h2>

URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. It contains serveral different parts, including:
<ul>
<li> the <strong>protocol</strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp
  <li> the <strong>host</strong>: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk
<li> the : e.g.<a href="www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>, <a href="www.bbc.co.uk">www.bbc.co.uk</a>
<li> the <strong>path</strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95
</ul>
<h2>DNS</h2>

DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. <a href= "123-reg">www.123-reg</a>, <a href= "GoDaddy">www.GoDaddy</a>). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism. <h2>Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</h2>

<h3>Client-side</h3>

Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:
<ol>
<li> HTML
<li>CSS
<li> Javascript
</ol>
<h3>Server-side</h3>

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
